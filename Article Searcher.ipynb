The group without cardiac marker abnormalities comprised patients without elevation in the levels of any of the cardiac markers. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on the day of admission.

However, the non-definite AMI patients with and without cardiac markers abnormalities did not use cardioprotective medication. All the 53 patients were administered nasal cannula oxygen therapy during admission for respiratory support; non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was performed for five AMI and three non-definite AMI patients with cardiac marker abnormalities.
